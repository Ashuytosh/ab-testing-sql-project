# ab-testing-sql-project
A/B Testing project using SQL to compare two campaigns. Includes metric calculations like conversion rate, revenue per visitor, and final decision based on data.
# A/B Testing: Introduction
A/B Testing is a statistical method used to compare two versions of a product, webpage, or campaign — typically a control group (A) and a test group (B) — to determine which one performs better against a defined metric. It’s widely used in marketing, product design, and user experience optimization to drive data-informed decisions instead of relying on intuition.
# Below are the key metrics used in this A/B Testing project, defined clearly for interpretability:

# Impressions
The number of times users were shown a campaign or product offer — regardless of whether they interacted with it or not.

# Clicks
Total number of times users clicked on the campaign after viewing it. This indicates initial engagement.

# Click-Through Rate (CTR)
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) * 100
This tells how effective the campaign is in generating clicks from users who viewed it.

# Conversions
Number of users who completed a desired action (like making a purchase) after clicking on the campaign.

# Conversion Rate
Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Clicks) * 100
Measures how many users converted out of those who clicked — this shows how persuasive the campaign is post-click.
